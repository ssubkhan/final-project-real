                    <div class="bio">
                    <p>Daphne Oram (1925–2003) was a British composer, electronic music innovator, and one of the first women to forge a career in the field of sound engineering. She is best known for co-founding the BBC Radiophonic Workshop in 1958, where she helped develop early electronic music and sound effects. Oram's experimental approach to sound led her to create the Oramics technique, a groundbreaking method of composing with sound that involved drawing waveforms on film. Throughout her career, Oram combined her interest in technology with her artistic vision, making a significant impact on the development of electronic music and sound design. Her contributions remain influential in the fields of music technology and experimental composition.</p>
