                    An <em>Inclusion In The Recording Studio?</em> survey determined that in 2021, only 14.4% of songwriters were women. According to a study conducted by online recruitment service Zippia, out of over 9,796 audio engineers currently employed in the United States, 7.7% of all audio engineers are women, while 92.3% are men. Fewer than 5% of the people creating the sounds, music, and media in the daily soundtrack of our lives are women or gender-expansive individuals - and there has been an alarming 70% decline in women/gender-expansive students enrolling in college STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Math) programs since the year 2000.

                        <p>Daphne Oram (1925‚Äì2003) was a British composer, electronic music innovator, and one of the first women to forge a career in the field of sound engineering. She is best known for co-founding the BBC Radiophonic Workshop in 1958, where she helped develop early electronic music and sound effects. Oram's experimental approach to sound led her to create the Oramics technique, a groundbreaking method of composing with sound that involved drawing waveforms on film. Throughout her career, Oram combined her interest in technology with her artistic vision, making a significant impact on the development of electronic music and sound design. Her contributions remain influential in the fields of music technology and experimental composition.</p>
