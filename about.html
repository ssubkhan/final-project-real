                   Hello! My name is Shantelle, I am a current student at the University of Michigan studying audio engineering. I have always been fascinated by the intersection of music, technology, and creativity, and my journey in audio engineering has allowed me to explore this passion in depth. As a woman in a male-dominated industry, I’m committed to not only mastering the technical aspects of audio but also contributing to the growing presence of women in the field.

                   Through my studies and hands-on experience, I’ve had the opportunity to work on various projects, from recording and mixing music to live sound engineering. I’m passionate about creating high-quality, immersive sound experiences and empowering others to pursue their own audio engineering dreams.
                   
                  One of the most wonderful opportunities I have found has been a local middle school program that I help run, where we hold an after school 'beat club' for kids in 6th - 8th grade. I built this website with them, and the educational websites I grew up with in mind. Representation is such a powerful thing, and my hope here was to make it a little easier to access!
